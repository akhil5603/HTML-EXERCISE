    <b>In music,<strong>sonata</strong>represents a principle of composing large-scale works. </b>
    <i>It is a mélange of scales, rhythms, performers, and instruments — creating a performance that is both inspiring and marvelous.</i>
    <mark>This resonates with our core beliefs and founding principles, one of the many reasons why we chose the name ‘Sonata’.</mark>
